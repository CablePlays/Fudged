            This website is still being developed. <span class='error'>It is not yet possible to make real purchases!</span>
            <span class='success'>However, if you would like to help out, you can make test purchases with the credit card number provided on the Yoco checkout page.</span>
            Additionally, many images still need to be added the home page and shop, and so placeholders are being used for now.
            Finally, the provided masses and prices of products may still change.

                    Every time you purchase fudge, you are rewarded with grams equivalent to the total weight of fudge bought.
                    You can use these grams to purchase eggs and hatch your own puppies (yes, dogs come from eggs).
                    Grow your puppies using dog food and earn free fudge for every fully grown dog!
